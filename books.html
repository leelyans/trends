                <p>Will, forgiveness and faith. The spirit of I
can do, an act of goodwill, keeps your hands
from clenching. It takes practice to actually
operate from a positive mindset, rather
than just conceptually understanding that
it’s a good idea to do so. In my experience, a
lot of this practice can happen on the level
of reframing verbal This in turn will shift
your thoughts and that is the power of a
positive mind. The good thing about having
a positive mind is that it makes people feel
like they can achieve anything that they
want in life.</p>

                <p>“A Folk Tale from Bicumbi” inspires
intercultural awareness and it describes
how different perspectives lead to distinct
points of views. The tale revolves around
the argument between six blind people over
the real size and shape of a cow. To resolve
their contention, these blind men and
women decided to take Mulinda’s cowshed
where lots of cows were known to be kept.
In the end, it is Mulinda who settled this
contention by confirming that a cow is a
much bigger creature than the biggest goat
so disability is not inability. </p>

                <p>“Aunt Jeninah” is an upper level nursery
rhyme. The rhyme introduces the
vocabulary used to describe the number
of children born on the same day from the
same mother. Other than the common term
“twins”, the author takes the reader beyond.
For each set of children, there is an
accompanying image to make it clearer for
the reader</p>

                <p>In this tale, the author tells us that the dog
was originally a wild animal. It was a close
friend with the lion, hyena and Leopold.
They used to share whatever kills for their
food. The dog wasn’t a sincere fiend. It
would eat its kill from where it killed from
and then come back home empty handed
expecting to share on the kills of his friends.
Tired of this selfishness, the three friends
decided to chase away the dog from their
company. It is this battle that the three
dehorned the dog. That’s how dog ended up
running into man’s care. </p>
